Challenge1 -------> Sol1
---------------------------------
challenge1:

Saying Hello
The “Hello, World” program is the first program you learn
to write in many languages, but it doesn’t involve any input.
So create a program that prompts for your name and prints
a greeting using your name.
Example Output
What is your name? Brian
Hello, Brian, nice to meet you!
Constraint
• Keep the input, string concatenation, and output separate.
Challenges
• Write a new version of the program without using any
variables.
• Write a version of the program that displays different
greetings for different people. This would be a good
challenge to try after you’ve completed the exercises in
Chapter 4, Making Decisions, on page 29 and Chapter 7,
Data Structures, on page 63.

----------------------------------
Challenge2
Counting the Number of Characters
Create a program that prompts for an input string and displays
output that shows the input string and the number of
characters the string contains.
Example Output
What is the input string? Homer
Homer has 5 characters.
Constraints
• Be sure the output contains the original string.
• Use a single output statement to construct the output.
• Use a built-in function of the programming language to
determine the length of the string.
Challenges
• If the user enters nothing, state that the user must enter
something into the program.
• Implement this program using a graphical user interface
and update the character counter every time a key is
pressed. If your language doesn’t have a particularly
friendly GUI library, try doing this exercise with HTML
and JavaScript instead.
